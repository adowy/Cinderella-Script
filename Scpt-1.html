Bitcoin Story of Cinderella üéÄüßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Scene- [Night, 21:00] A girl crying in her room facing the window and writing (scribbling) in her diary. Let's call her Sia.

Sia: (sobbing) I wish I could go to prom tomorrow but stepmom ain't allowin' it! She declined all my credit cards, I can't even buy a dress!
(takes a deep breath and looks at the window)
Oh, fairy mother, my mom, how much I wish to dance with Jack! 

(a tear rolls) Mom... Please come here!

*A flying pigeon drops a piece of paper outside her window* 
*She picks it up and the paper has a Web wallet secret key* (fake key, obviously) 

Sia (shocked): Mom, (looks at the sky) is this really you? Wait,  did you send this?

(Voice from sky) Mom: Yes my love, Get ready for prom! 

Sia: But I have no dress!

Mom: Opens your laptop and check Web Wallet. I am sending you 500$ Bitcoins now. Shop for your dress in the morning.

Sia: [camera position: on phone] (notification comes) (checks her wallet) Wait, how did you do that? 

Mom: With Bitcoin Web Wallet, you can transfer money anywhere now! Protect your money and mental peace!
Hey, also, protect this secret key from step momma! 

Sia: (smiles) You saved my world mom! It's so easy to use!

Mom: Anytime darlin'!
